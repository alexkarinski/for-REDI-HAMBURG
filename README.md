# for-REDI-HAMBURG by Karinski

I’m Alex Karinsky, I’m from Kyiv, but I live in Hamburg. I want to join Redi School. Since you asked for just a simple repository, I’m providing it to you. Unfortunately, I didn’t see any specific requests or changes to the code.

If you want any changes, just let me know, and I’ll make the necessary adjustments!
